# MinComplexityMorphoAnalogies

Implementation of the algorithm described in "Solving analogies on words based on minimal complexity transformation" (Murena, P.-A., Al-Ghossein, M., Dessalles, J.-L. and Cornu√©jols, A., IJCAI 2020).

The algorithm is used for solving analogical equations of the type A : B :: C : x, where x is unknown and the question reads "A is to B as C is to x", specifically in the morphological domain (A, B, C and x are character strings and the transformation from A to B corresponds to a morphological transformation, e.g. declension or conjugation). 

No specific package is required.
